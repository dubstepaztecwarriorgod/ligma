# Ligma Image Format

## What is ligma?

Ligma is one of the first ever human readable and writable image formats that is supported in several languages!
It follows the philosphy that images should be simple and easy to write and read, that's why every pixel in a ligma image is just the name of the color!
Yup that's it, just type up the image you want in a valid square or rectangle and you're golden!
